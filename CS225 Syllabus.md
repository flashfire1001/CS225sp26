# CS 225 Spring 2026 Course Information

```text
Study Guide:
Do all the study before the semester(if you are able to)/lecture begins
Do the reproduction of codes in c++, with Hello-Algo/Slides from lecture. makes these codes as your foundation
Keep a strict track of the course progress, YOU MUST BE INFORMED AND HARDWORDING to get an A-grade! Any stay active and positive!

## Course Theme

This course teaches a variety of ways to store collections of data in a computer program and discusses the advantages and disadvantages associated with the different methods. You will learn how to build various data-storage structures, and you’ll discover why you might prefer one over another in a particular situation.

The first 3–4 weeks will be a crash course in **C++**, focusing on:
* Generic programming
* Object-oriented programming
* Manual memory management

Almost all MPs are **solo assignments**. All **labs** will allow you to work in **groups of up to 2.**

For labs, you are allowed to work with at most one partner. A collaborative environment is good for learning, and especially if you and your friends are new to the material, helping each other when you get stuck can benefit all of you. (Please note, each student must hand in her/his own copy of the assignment and it cannot be identical to their partner’s.) All collaboration must be credited in the `partners.txt` file submitted with each lab. If you work alone, you should still add your own INTL ID. And,for each cooperatively completed section(block)of code,use the commenting feature in C++to indicate the INTL ID(s) of the person(s) who completed the code:you,your partner, or both INTL IDs.
